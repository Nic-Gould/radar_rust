OK don't judge me too harshly on this one, as I knocked most of this up in notepad (not NPP) while at work. 

Just a basic sketch for a pulsed doppler radar. lots of things missing. hardware is going to be a bottleneck. 

As a design goal I want to be able to ping the careflight helicopter on the way to the hospital near my house, so I'm looking at a max range of about 5km, radar cross section of a helicopter, transmission power of 240V 10A, though I could look into capacative storage as the duty cycle on the transmitter is pretty low.
